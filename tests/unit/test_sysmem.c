/* test_sysmem.c - the available-memory probe must return a real number on every
 * platform the engine builds on.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 *   Two refusals in k3_run.c compare the memory plan against what the machine can
 *   actually hand out: the KV cache check and the whole-plan check before
 *   allocation. Both are written as "if (available > 0 && need > available)", so a
 *   probe that returns 0 does not fail loudly, it silently disables both guards, and
 *   --preset auto refuses outright. Before src/cli/k3_sysmem.h the probe was
 *   /proc/meminfo behind #ifdef _WIN32, which is exactly 0 on macOS. This test fails
 *   on any platform where the number is 0 or impossible.
 *
 * usage: test_sysmem
