/* k3_state.h - the conversation state file behind --save-state / --load-state.
 *
 * Everything the engine carries between tokens, on disk. The point is turn two of a
 * conversation: without this, resuming re-reads the whole prompt through all 93 layers,
 * which on a streamed trunk costs minutes; with it, a resumed session pays only for the
 * tokens actually new.
 *
 * Three things are carried, and only three: the KDA recurrent matrices plus ShortConv
 * history (fixed size, independent of context), the MLA KV cache, and the shared rope
 * rows. The AttnRes block buffer is NOT carried because forward() clears it on entry and
 * rebuilds it from the layer outputs every pass; saving it would be saving scratch.
 *
 * The KV cache is stored position-major inside each MLA layer's slice, so only the
 * OCCUPIED positions are written and a resumed run may size its cache differently. The
 * header carries a config fingerprint: restoring state built by a different architecture
 * would produce fluent, wrong output with nothing to indicate it, which is the one
 * failure mode this engine refuses to have.
 *
 * This lives outside k3_run.c so the format has a test that needs no checkpoint
 * (tests/unit/test_state.c): the arrays are just floats and ints of the sizes the header
 * declares, and every refusal below is reachable with synthetic ones. */
